# Evaluation of Climate Claims 
## Keyboard Warrior Critiques Climate Scientists

This article is titled : “2001-2019 Warming Driven By Increases In Absorbed Solar Radiation, Not Human Emissions”. The article briefly mentions three sources that support their claim that the Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI)  is being impacted most strongly by solar radiation and not human activity or greenhouse gas emissions (Anon, 2021). The article begins by citing Leob et al. (2021) where they claim that the article explicitly depicts changes in EEI as being virtually unrelated to human actions. Though the Loeb et al. (2021) article does explain and quantify the effects of solar radiation on changes in EEI, it does not explicitly rid humans of responsibility. A direct quote from this paper reads “ In addition to anthropogenic radiative forcing by WMGG, EEI is influenced by aerosol emissions and land use change as well as by natural forcings associated with volcanic emissions and variations in solar irradiance.” (Loeb et al., 2021). This quote opens with “In addition to”, this is not saying that anthropogenic radiative well-mixed greenhouse gases are not excluded from the list of causes mentioned.

The next paper cited in this article is by Dübal and Vahrenholt (2021). The article summarizes the paper by saying that longwave radiation has actually decreased overall temperature (Anon, 2021). Though this paper does mention the effects of longwave radiation, it also explains several other concepts that have contrasting effects on temperature. The paper also does not say outright that longwave radiation is responsible for current changes in climate. A quote from this paper says “Finally, the key issue, i.e., whether the current heating phase is a temporary phase or a permanent phenomenon, can be judged only on the basis of a longer observation time.” (Dübal and Vahrenholt, 2021). Thus solidifying that no conclusion has been reached on this data.

The final paper cited by this article is by Ollila (2021). In the article, the author quotes the paper saying “any temperature increase since 2015-’16 cannot be due to anthropogenic reasons.” (Anon, 2021). Upon searching the article, the cited quote did exist and was within the cited context. The paper by Ollila (2021) states that the lack of anthropogenic causation has not been properly recorded and the effects of omitting this information is damaging to the general understanding of climate change as we know it (Ollila, 2021).

Overall, this article is completely non-credible. Brock University Library provides a clear outline for the evaluation of credible sources. The article in question passes very few of the criteria listed. The first, and arguably the most significant, issue I found with this article is that it is written by “Guest User”. Unless that is some unfortunate naming circumstance, I do not think that it is possible to assess the qualifications, the subject of expertise, or their affiliations if they are nameless behind a screen. The lack of author credibility and authority contributes to the overall lack of credibility of the article. Though the article cites credible sources, it does not use them appropriately which makes their citation completely irrelevant. This article also suffers from extreme objectivity bias as the information in the article contains mostly opinions and has a strong political message. The only redeeming quality to substantiate credibility in this article is its recency, however the date of an article is irrelevant if none of the information it contains is factually accurate.
